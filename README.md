# ConsoleQuiz

Create a new project, and call it ConsoleQuiz.

Create 2 class files (right click in the solution explorer, then go to add->class) and name them Question, and Results.

Copy the code into these files, ensuring you have named the class file correctly.

(Program.cs will be automatically generated for you, replace it with the one here.)

Open Program.cs and edit a;; the questions and answers - the comments explain what is what.

Cheers,

-J
